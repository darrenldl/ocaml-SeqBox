# ocaml-SeqBox
Implementation of [SeqBox](https://github.com/MarcoPon/SeqBox) in OCaml

The original pharsing was "Port of SeqBox to OCaml", but since no direct porting/translation was actually done due to the differences between Python 3(implementation language of SeqBox) and OCaml, which also force the architecture and design of this software(ocaml-SeqBox) to be independently developed, thus this is only an implementation(not a port or translation) of SeqBox according to its technical specifications.
This is mainly to address the different licenses being used(SeqBox was using AGPL 3.0 at the time of writing while this project uses 3-Clause BSD license).

## Acknowledgement
I would like to thank [Marco](https://github.com/MarcoPon) (author of the official SeqBox) for discussing and clarifying several aspects of his project, and providing me with test data

I would like to thank [Ming](https://github.com/mdchia/) for his feedback on the documentation, UX design, and several other general aspects of this project. And also his help on testing the building and installation of osbx on macOS.

## Getting started
Osbx 1.0.0 is currently on OPAM, 1.0.1 (dev version) will be published shortly
```
opam install osbx
```
There are three modes/commands for osbx currently : encode, decode, rescue

You can consult the man pages of osbx itself and all the three commands via
```
osbx        --help
osbx encode --help
osbx decode --help
osbx rescue --help
```

## Notes
CRC-CCITT is currently implemented via FFI and links to the static object files compiled from libcrc (https://github.com/lammertb/libcrc)
  - See crcccitt_wrap.ml, crcccitt_wrap.mli for the FFI bindings
  - See crcccitt.c, checksum.h for libcrc source used(crcccitt.c is slightly modified, modification is under same license used by libcrc)

Exact behaviours in non-standard cases are not specified in official SeqBox technical specification
  - See [specification](SPECS.md) of ocaml-SeqBox for details on how ocaml-SeqBox behaves(if you care about undefined behaviour those sort of things)

Index of soure code
  - See [index](INDEX.md)

Changelog
  - See [changelog](CHANGELOG.md)

## Possibly useful additional features of ocaml-SeqBox(possibly not yet in official SeqBox)
  - Allows random ordering in sbx container
    - This also means block corruption will not stop the decoding process
  - Allows duplicate metadata/data blocks to exist within one sbx container
    - This means you can concatenate multiple copies of sbx container together directly to increase chance of recovery in case of corruption

## Technical Specification
The following specification is copied directly from the official specification (with possible slight modification).

Also see section "Features currently NOT planned to be implemented" for features ocaml-SeqBox is probably not going to have

Byte order: Big Endian
### Common blocks header:

| pos | to pos | size | desc                                |
|---- | ---    | ---- | ----------------------------------- |
|  0  |      2 |   3  | Recoverable Block signature = 'SBx' |
|  3  |      3 |   1  | Version byte |
|  4  |      5 |   2  | CRC-16-CCITT of the rest of the block (Version is used as starting value) |
|  6  |     11 |   6  | file UID                            |
| 12  |     15 |   4  | Block sequence number               |

### Block 0

| pos | to pos   | size | desc             |
|---- | -------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| 16  | n        | var  | encoded metadata |
|  n+1| blockend | var  | padding (0x1a)   |

### Blocks > 0 & < last:

| pos | to pos   | size | desc             |
|---- | -------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| 16  | blockend | var  | data             |

### Blocks == last:

| pos | to pos   | size | desc             |
|---- | -------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| 16  | n        | var  | data             |
| n+1 | blockend | var  | padding (0x1a)   |

### Versions:
N.B. Current versions differs only by blocksize.

| ver | blocksize | note    |
|---- | --------- | ------- |
|  1  | 512       | default |
|  2  | 128       |         |
|  3  | 4096      |         |

All versions are implemented in ocaml-SeqBox

### Metadata encoding:

| Bytes | Field | 
| ----- | ----- |
|    3  | ID    |
|    1  | Len   |
|    n  | Data  |

#### IDs

| ID | Desc |
| --- | --- |
| FNM | filename (utf-8) |
| SNM | sbx filename (utf-8) |
| FSZ | filesize (8 bytes) |
| FDT | date & time (8 bytes, seconds since epoch) |
| SDT | sbx date & time (8 bytes) |
| HSH | crypto hash (SHA256, using [Multihash](http://multiformats.io) protocol) |
| PID | parent UID (*not used at the moment*)|

#### Features currently NOT planned to be implemented
  - Data hiding (XOR encoding/decoding in official seqbox)
    - Provides neither sufficiently strong encryption nor sufficient stealth for any serious attempt to hide/secure data
    - You should use the appropriate tools for encryption
