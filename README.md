# ocaml-SeqBox
Implementation of SeqBox in OCaml

The original pharsing was "Port of SeqBox to OCaml", but since no direct porting/translation was actually done due to the differences between Python 3(implementation language of SeqBox) and OCaml, which also force the architecture and design of this software(ocaml-SeqBox) to be independently developed, thus this is only an implementation(not a port or translation) of SeqBox according to its technical specifications.
This is mainly to address the different licenses being used(SeqBox uses AGPL 3.0 while this project uses 3-Clause BSD license).

## Technical Specification
The following specification fully follows the official specs for version 1.
Version 2, 3 are not implemented (see below).

Byte order: Big Endian
### Common blocks header:

| pos | to pos | size | desc                                |
|---- | ---    | ---- | ----------------------------------- |
|  0  |      2 |   3  | Recoverable Block signature = 'SBx' |
|  3  |      3 |   1  | Version byte |
|  4  |      5 |   2  | CRC-16-CCITT of the rest of the block (Version is used as starting value) |
|  6  |     11 |   6  | file UID                            |
| 12  |     15 |   4  | Block sequence number               |

### Block 0

| pos | to pos   | size | desc             |
|---- | -------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| 16  | n        | var  | encoded metadata |
|  n+1| blockend | var  | padding (0x1a)   |

### Blocks > 0 & < last:

| pos | to pos   | size | desc             |
|---- | -------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| 16  | blockend | var  | data             |

### Blocks == last:

| pos | to pos   | size | desc             |
|---- | -------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| 16  | n        | var  | data             |
| n+1 | blockend | var  | padding (0x1a)   |

### Versions:
N.B. Current versions differs only by blocksize.

| ver | blocksize | note    |
|---- | --------- | ------- |
|  1  | 512       | default |
|  2  | 128       | NOT IMPLEMENTED |
|  3  | 4096      | NOT IMPLEMENTED |

### Metadata encoding:

| Bytes | Field | 
| ----- | ----- |
|    3  | ID    |
|    1  | Len   |
|    n  | Data  |

#### IDs

| ID | Desc |
| --- | --- |
| FNM | filename (utf-8) |
| SNM | sbx filename (utf-8) |
| FSZ | filesize (8 bytes) |
| FDT | date & time (8 bytes, seconds since epoch) |
| SDT | sbx date & time (8 bytes) |
| HSH | crypto hash (SHA256, using [Multihash](http://multiformats.io) protocol) |
| PID | parent UID (*not used at the moment*)|
